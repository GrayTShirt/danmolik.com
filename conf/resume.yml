Experience:
  - name: Synacor Inc.
    location: Buffalo, New York
    title: Monitoring Tools Engineer
    duration: February 2013 to present
    description: As the most senior Monitoring engineer, I am tasked with the performance and visibility of 4500 hosts, 120,000 checks, and 1.2 million datapoints, across 9 data-centers. I am responsible for a series of Nagios/Icinga high availability server pairs in each of the data-centers, along with dedicated log processing and offload worker servers. All other responsibilities are derived from this monitoring and visibility Mandate.
      Over the past 2 years I have gone from knowing nothing about Perl, to using it to write stats checks, email step-through, and a synthetic/front end testing system, known as Lithium.
      Lithium is a Selenium WebDriver/Full Stack framework for monitoring production, business critical, user-models, such as log-ins, Javascript rendered content, and menubar functionality. The key to Lithium's success is making the transition from a highly parallel web-browser domain to serial monitoring steps, seamless and straight forward.
      Additionally my duties include a 24/7 on-call rotation, where I am called on a consistent basis, to consult on issues related to the operability of Synacor's systems.
      I also consult with engineering and operational teams at Synacor as to the best method to monitor new systems and services.
      As an added benefit, I use Puppet and Git on a daily basis to roll out changes to the monitoring for threshold changes, datapoint changes and graph changes.
